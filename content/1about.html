Welcome to my site!

<p>I finally decided to build my own home on the internet! I am no designer and no web developer, but I do have attention to detail. I know some HTML, CSS and Javascript, although I wanted to do this project with pure CSS.</p>
<p>It's part of a project to build a personal brand that captures what I am all about.</p>
